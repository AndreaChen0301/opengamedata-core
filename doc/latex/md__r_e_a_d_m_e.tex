Python3 implementation of the Open Game Gata feature extractor

This code pulls raw game data from a S\+QL database, chooses appropiate features to extract based on the \char`\"{}game\+\_\+id\char`\"{} and writes results to a csv file for data mining

See \href{http://opengamedata.fielddaylab.wisc.edu}{\texttt{ http\+://opengamedata.\+fielddaylab.\+wisc.\+edu}} for .sql exports of raw game data and the assocated output of this code based on several games produced by Field Day.

Please feel free to modify this code, add new features or games and share back to the authors. We will deploy improvements to the Open Game Data site.
