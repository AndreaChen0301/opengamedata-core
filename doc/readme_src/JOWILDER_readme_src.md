## Data Logging Info:
See https://github.com/fielddaylab/jo_wilder/blob/master/README.md

Jo Wilder data is organized into levels, where each level corresponds to a "save code"/chapter in the game.
Many of the extracted features, however, are based on individual interactions with the environment, or game objectives.
