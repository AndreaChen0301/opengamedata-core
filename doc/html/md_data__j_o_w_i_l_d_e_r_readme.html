<h2>Game: WAVES</h2>
<h2>Field Descriptions:</h2>
<h3>Raw CSV Columns:</h3>
<p>id - Unique identifier for a row app_id - A string identifying which game from which the event came app_id_fast - A second version of the app id, to be removed app_version - The version of the game from which the event came session_id - Unique identifier for the gameplay session persistent_session_id - Unique identifier across all gameplay sessions from a single computer level - The game level in which the event was logged event - The type of event logged event_custom - A number corresponding to the game-specific event type for events labeled 'Custom' event_data_simple - Unused (always=0), to be deleted event_data_complex - Data specific to an event type, encoded as a JSON string client_time - The client machine time when the event was generated client_time_ms - Client time in milliseconds server_time - The server machine time when the event was logged remote_addr - The IP address for the player's computer req_id - Another ID of some kind, to be removed session_n - Counter of events in the session, from 0. A row with session_n = i is the (i+1)-th event of the session http_user_agent - Data on the type of web browser, OS, etc. in use by the player</p>
<h3>Processed Features:</h3>
<p>totalSliderMoves - slider moves across a given level [count of 'SLIDER_MOVE_RELEASE' events] totalArrowMoves - arrow moves across a given level [count of 'ARROW_MOVE_RELEASE' events] totalLevelTime - time spent on a level [sum of differences in time between 'BEGIN' and 'COMPLETE' event(s)] sliderAvgStdDevs - Average of stdev_val for all slider moves in a level totalMoveTypeChanges - number of times 'slider' changes across a level sliderAvgRange - difference between max and min values of a slider move, averaged together across a level totalResets - number of times the user pressed the 'reset' button across a level totalFails - number of 'Fail' events across a level totalSkips - number of times the player chose to skip the level (only allowed if they already completed the level once) menuBtnCount - number of times the player returned to the main menu. [count of 'MENU_BUTTON' events] beginCount - number of times a player 'began' the level. [count of 'BEGIN' events] succeedCount - number of times a 'SUCCEED' event occurs. [count of 'SUCCEED' events] completeCount - number of times a player 'completed' the level. [count of 'COMPLETE' events] completed - whether the level was completed or not [bool whether 'COMPLETE' event was found] percentAmplitudeMoves - percent of total moves that were amplitude adjustments in a level percentOffsetMoves - percent of total moves that were offset adjustments in a level percentWavelengthMoves - percent of total moves that were wavelength adjustments in a level amplitudeGoodMoveCount - number of amplitude moves that brought amplitude closer to the correct value offsetGoodMoveCount - number of offset moves that brought offset closer to the correct value wavelengthGoodMoveCount - number of wavelength moves that brought wavelength closer to the correct value percentAmplitudeGoodMoves - percent of amplitude moves that brought amplitude closer to the correct value percentOffsetGoodMoves - percent of wavelength moves that brought wavelength closer to the correct value percentWavelengthGoodMoves - percent of wavelength moves that brought wavelength closer to the correct value firstMoveType - A character indicating what type of slider move a player made first. A = Amplitude, W = Wavelength, O = Offset, null = No moves closenessSlope - The slope of the linear regression line of (closeness vs. time (seconds)) for the level closenessIntercept - The intercept of the linear regression line of (closeness vs. time (seconds)) for the level closenessR2 - The R^2 of the linear regression line of (closeness vs. time (seconds)) for the level rangeSlope - The slope of the linear regression line of (range vs. time (seconds)) for the level, where range is the total range of moves (max-min in the case of a slider, abs(begin-end) in case of an arrow) rangeIntercept - The intercept of the linear regression line of (range vs. time (seconds)) for the level, where range is the total range of moves (max-min in the case of a slider, abs(begin-end) in case of an arrow) rangeR2 - The R^2 of the linear regression line of (range vs. time (seconds)) for the level, where range is the total range of moves (max-min in the case of a slider, abs(begin-end) in case of an arrow) sessionID - The player's session ID number for this play session persistentSessionID - The session ID for the player's device, persists across multiple players using the same device. avgSliderMoves - totalSliderMoves averaged over all levels avgLevelTime - totalLevelTime averaged over all levels avgMoveTypeChanges - totalMoveTypeChanges averaged over all levels overallSliderAvgStdDevs - Average standard deviation of slider moves over a whole sessioin overallSliderAvgRange - Average range of slider moves over a whole session overallPercentAmplitudeMoves - Percent of total moves that were amplitude adjustments over a whole session overallPercentOffsetMoves - Percent of total moves that were offset adjustments over a whole session overallPercentWavelengthMoves - Percent of total moves that were wavelength adjustments over a whole session avgFails - totalFails averaged over all levels</p>
